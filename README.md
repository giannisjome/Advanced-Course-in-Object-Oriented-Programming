# Week 2 – Exercise 1: Exception Handling and Specifications

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for **Exercise 1** of Week 2, which focuses on exception handling and method specifications in Java.

The task was based on modifying a method to:

1. **Throw an exception** if the input array is empty or `null`.
2. **Detect negative numbers** in the array and report their positions and values using a custom exception.
3. **Calculate the average** of the array if it contains only non-negative numbers.
